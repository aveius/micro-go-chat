# micro-go-chat
Sample project to play with go, websockets, CI and Docker

Usual way to run a go thing:

    go get github.com/aveius/micro-go-chat
    go build github.com/aveius/micro-go-chat
    go run github.com/aveius/micro-go-chat

After that, open a couple browser windows on http://127.0.0.1:8080/, and you're off!

[ ] Docker deployment
